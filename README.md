My Journey of learning MySQL from Scratch.
Basic syntaxes to handling complex data 
I explored the full spectrum of
SQL capabilities, including: ðŸ’¡
âœ…Navigating JOINs and Subqueries.
âœ…Recognizing their power beyond syntaxâ€”transforming raw data into actionable insights.
âœ…Mastering SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements for efficient data handling , manipulation.
âœ…Delving into Data Modeling, SQL views.
âœ…Stored Procedures.
âœ…Data security and integration
âœ…Data driven decisions
âœ…Collaborate with other teams and analysts.

Through practical assignments, projects, and case studies (Data Mart, Data Bank, and Texture Tails), Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience.
Iâ€™m now equipped to optimize databases and crunch data! ðŸ“Š
